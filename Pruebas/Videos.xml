			<Title>START and STOP operations of a Wind Turbine</Title>
			<Help>In this video you can observe the evolution of the Wind Turbine of the Active Stall type, with squirrel cage electric Generator directly connected to the Grid, during two basic operations: START (from disconnected from the Grid to connection, and start production - <i>cutin</i>-), and STOP (from production state to stop state - <i>cutout</i>).

			<Title>Management of incidences</Title>
			<Help><i>Incidences</i> are a key concept in Wind Turbines: Wind Turbines are <i>Production Plants</i>, designed to operate in stand-alone mode, adapting their behavior to the changing conditions (wind speed, wind direction, failures in the Grid, internal failures, etc.)
			<p>Whenever a subsytem is not working properly, or some variable goes out of range, the its Controller supplies information (incidence) that can be used to analyse the actual condition of the Wind Turbine.</p>
			<p>Familiarity with the possible <i>incidences</i> in a Wind Turbine is a must for any one involved in its Operation and Maintenance</p>
