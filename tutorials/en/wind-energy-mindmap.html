  <h1>Wind Energy Knowledge Map</h1>
  <p>A comprehensive structural view of wind energy technology</p>
</section>

<main class="tut-content">

  <h2>Mapping the entire discipline</h2>
  <p>
    ACMSL has created a <strong>comprehensive mind map</strong> covering all industrial aspects of wind energy.
    This knowledge map serves as both a learning guide and a reference tool, organizing the vast body of
    knowledge required by wind energy professionals into a clear, navigable structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mind map is bilingual (Spanish/English) and contains hundreds of interconnected topics, from
    fundamental physics to project finance, from meteorology to safety regulations. It represents years of
    accumulated expertise distilled into a single, structured document.

    <p>
      The historical evolution of wind energy, current market status worldwide, the environmental context
      driving the energy transition, and the regulatory frameworks that shape the industry. Essential
      background for understanding why the sector operates the way it does.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>2. Wind Resource</h4>
    <p>
      Wind resource assessment methodology, meteorological fundamentals, wind measurement techniques
      (anemometry, LiDAR, SODAR), wind data analysis, Weibull distributions, micrositing optimization,
      and wake effects. The foundation of every wind energy project.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>3. Physical Principles</h4>
    <p>
      Aerodynamics of wind turbine blades (BEM theory, lift and drag, tip-speed ratio), electrical
      machine principles (induction and synchronous generators), and power electronics (converters,
      inverters, PWM modulation). The physics that makes wind energy conversion possible.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>4. Power Generation &amp; Distribution</h4>
    <p>
      Electrical grid characteristics, grid connection requirements, grid codes and compliance,
      energy storage technologies, power quality standards, and reactive power management. How wind
      energy integrates with the electrical system.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>5. Instrumentation &amp; Control</h4>
    <p>
      Industrial sensors and transducers, communication protocols (Modbus, OPC, IEC 61400-25),
      control algorithms (PID, state machines, MPPT), SCADA systems, and condition monitoring.
      The nervous system of modern wind turbines.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>6. Wind Farms</h4>
    <p>
      Site evaluation and selection, project management and development, construction and commissioning,
      production estimation and optimization, operation and maintenance strategies, electrical
      substations, and balance of plant. The complete lifecycle of a wind farm project.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>7. Wind Turbines</h4>
    <p>
      Design principles and IEC classification, the 5 generator families, major components (tower,
      blades, nacelle, hub, gearbox, generator, converter, foundation), advanced control strategies,
      and current manufacturer landscape. Deep technical knowledge of the machines themselves.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>8. Weather Forecasting</h4>
    <p>
      Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, mesoscale modeling, ensemble forecasting techniques,
      statistical downscaling, and forecast verification. Critical for grid integration and energy
      trading.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>9. Economics &amp; Finance</h4>
    <p>
      CAPEX and OPEX breakdown, Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) calculation, financial viability
      analysis, business models (PPA, merchant, feed-in tariffs), project financing structures,
      and investment risk assessment. The business case for wind energy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>10. Environmental &amp; Social Aspects</h4>
    <p>
      Fauna impact assessment (birds, bats), noise emissions and propagation models, visual impact
      evaluation, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures, social acceptance, and community
      benefit schemes. Responsible development of wind energy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>11. Safety &amp; Health</h4>
    <p>
      Safety norms and regulations, GWO (Global Wind Organisation) certification programs, Personal
      Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements, emergency procedures, risk assessment methodologies,
      and specific hazards of wind turbine work (heights, electrical, confined spaces, rescue).
      Keeping people safe in a demanding industrial environment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>About the knowledge map</h2>
  <p>
    The wind energy knowledge map was created using <strong>Freeplane</strong>, a free and open-source
    mind mapping application. The mind map format allows for hierarchical organization of topics with
    unlimited depth, making it ideal for representing the complex, interconnected nature of wind energy
    technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    The map is continuously updated as the technology evolves, with new topics added to reflect the
    latest developments in offshore wind, grid-forming inverters, hydrogen production from wind,
    and other emerging areas.
  </p>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>A living document</h4>
    <p>
      The knowledge map is not a static reference &mdash; it is a living document that grows with the
      industry. Each branch contains dozens of sub-topics organized in a logical hierarchy, with
      cross-references between related areas. Whether you are a newcomer seeking an overview or an
      experienced professional looking for a specific technical detail, the knowledge map provides
      a structured path to the information you need.
