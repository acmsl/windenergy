  <h1>The 5 Families of Industrial Wind Turbines</h1>
  <p>From fixed-speed pioneers to modern variable-speed powerhouses</p>
</section>

<main class="tut-content">

  <h2>Classification criteria</h2>
  <p>
    Industrial wind turbines are classified into <strong>5 families</strong> based on two key design choices:
    the <strong>blade pitch control mechanism</strong> (how the blades regulate aerodynamic power) and the
    <strong>generator type and grid connection</strong> (how electrical power is produced and delivered to
    the grid). Understanding these families is essential for any wind energy professional, as each family
    has distinct operational characteristics, control strategies, and grid interaction capabilities.
  </p>

  <h2>Family 1: Fixed Pitch + Squirrel Cage (directly connected)</h2>

  <figure class="tut-figure">
    <img src="img/Aerog pala fija jaula ardilla.png" alt="Family 1 - Fixed pitch, squirrel cage wind turbine">
    <figcaption>Family 1: Fixed pitch blades with squirrel cage induction generator, directly connected to the grid</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The earliest industrial wind turbines used <strong>fixed pitch blades</strong> (also called stall-regulated)
    combined with a <strong>squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG)</strong> connected directly to the grid.
    These machines relied on the natural aerodynamic stall phenomenon to limit power in high winds.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typical power range:</strong> up to 300 kW</li>
    <li><strong>Era:</strong> 1980s &ndash; early 1990s (historical)</li>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Extremely simple and robust design, low manufacturing cost, minimal
    control electronics</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Poor energy capture efficiency, no ability to support wind gusts,
    fixed speed operation causes high mechanical loads, no reactive power control, significant power
    quality issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Family 2: Active Stall + Squirrel Cage (directly connected)</h2>

  <figure class="tut-figure">
    <img src="img/Aerog active stall.png" alt="Family 2 - Active stall wind turbine">
    <figcaption>Family 2: Variable pitch (active stall) with squirrel cage induction generator</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The active stall design introduces <strong>variable pitch blades</strong> that rotate toward stall
    (increasing the angle of attack) to regulate power. The generator remains a squirrel cage induction
    machine directly connected to the grid, often with <strong>dual speed capability</strong> (two
    separate windings for low and high wind speeds).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typical power range:</strong> 600 &ndash; 1,300 kW</li>
    <li><strong>Era:</strong> 1990s &ndash; 2000s, still manufactured for specific markets</li>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Good cost-to-production ratio for stable wind sites, proven reliability,
    pitch control adds safety and regulation capabilities</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Still essentially fixed speed, limited gust support, no reactive power
    control, dual-speed switching creates transient loads</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Why start learning here?</h4>
    <p>
      Family 2 turbines are the ideal starting point for training. Their relatively straightforward
      control system &mdash; combining pitch regulation with a directly-connected generator &mdash; allows
      learners to grasp fundamental concepts (power regulation, speed thresholds, yaw control, safety systems)
      without the complexity of power electronics. The ACMSL <strong>Dual Speed Active Stall (DSAS) simulator</strong>
      is designed for exactly this purpose.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Family 3: Variable Pitch + Variable Rotor Resistance</h2>

  <figure class="tut-figure">
    <img src="img/Aerog resistencia rotor.png" alt="Family 3 - Variable rotor resistance wind turbine">
    <figcaption>Family 3: Variable pitch with variable rotor resistance (wound rotor induction generator)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This family uses a <strong>wound rotor induction generator (WRIG)</strong> with external resistors
    connected to the rotor circuit. By varying the rotor resistance, the generator's torque-speed
    characteristic can be modified, allowing <strong>limited variable speed operation</strong> (typically
    &plusmn;10% around synchronous speed).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typical power range:</strong> 1,500 &ndash; 1,800 kW</li>
    <li><strong>Era:</strong> Late 1990s &ndash; 2000s</li>
    <li><strong>Technology example:</strong> Vestas OptiSlip system</li>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Moderate wind gust support through speed variation, better energy capture
    than fixed-speed designs, reduced mechanical stress during gusts</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Energy dissipated as heat in the rotor resistors, limited speed range,
    no reactive power control capability</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>The bridge to modern designs</h4>
    <p>
      Family 3 represents the engineering compromise between simplicity and performance. Learning its
      control strategy &mdash; especially how rotor resistance modulation absorbs wind gusts &mdash;
      provides crucial insight into why the industry moved toward more advanced converter-based solutions.
      The ACMSL <strong>Rotor Resistance Controller (RRC) simulator</strong> teaches these concepts hands-on.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Family 4: DFIG &mdash; Doubly-Fed Induction Generator</h2>

  <figure class="tut-figure">
    <img src="img/Aerog dfig.png" alt="Family 4 - DFIG wind turbine">
    <figcaption>Family 4: DFIG with partial Back-to-Back converter &mdash; the most widely installed type</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The DFIG is the <strong>most common wind turbine family</strong> in the global installed fleet. It uses
    a wound rotor induction generator where the <strong>stator is directly connected to the grid</strong> while
    the <strong>rotor is fed through a Back-to-Back (B2B) power converter</strong>. Because the converter
    only handles the slip power (approximately <strong>30% of nominal power</strong>), it is significantly
    smaller and cheaper than a full-power converter.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typical power range:</strong> 1.5 &ndash; 3 MW (and beyond)</li>
    <li><strong>Era:</strong> 2000s &ndash; present, still the most installed family</li>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Wide variable speed range (&plusmn;30% around synchronous speed)</li>
        <li>Excellent wind gust support through kinetic energy absorption</li>
        <li>Full reactive power control (4-quadrant operation)</li>
        <li>Grid support capabilities (voltage regulation, frequency response)</li>
        <li>Cost-effective: converter handles only ~30% of power</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Requires slip rings and brushes (maintenance), crowbar protection
    during grid faults, more complex control system</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>The industry workhorse</h4>
    <p>
      Understanding DFIG technology is arguably the most important skill for wind energy professionals.
      The interaction between stator flux, rotor currents, and the B2B converter creates a fascinating
      and powerful control system. The ACMSL <strong>DFIG simulator</strong> provides a comprehensive
      training environment for mastering this technology, including reactive power management and
      grid code compliance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Family 5: Full Converter</h2>
  <p>
    The full converter family decouples the generator completely from the grid using a power converter that
    handles <strong>100% of the nominal power</strong>. This provides maximum flexibility in both generator
    design and grid interaction.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Generator options:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) &mdash; most common in new designs</li>
        <li>Electrically Excited Synchronous Generator (EESG) &mdash; used by Enercon</li>
        <li>Squirrel cage or wound rotor asynchronous generators</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Drivetrain options:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct drive (no gearbox) &mdash; large, slow-rotating generator</li>
        <li>Medium-speed with single-stage gearbox &mdash; compromise solution</li>
        <li>High-speed with multi-stage gearbox &mdash; smaller generator</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Full speed range, complete grid decoupling, excellent fault ride-through,
    enables direct drive (eliminates gearbox failures), best grid support capabilities</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Full-power converter is more expensive, higher converter losses,
    direct drive generators are very large and heavy</li>
    <li><strong>Typical power range:</strong> 3 &ndash; 21 MW (dominant in large offshore turbines)</li>
  </ul>
