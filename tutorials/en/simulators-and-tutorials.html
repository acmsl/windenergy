  <h1>Real-Time Simulators, Tutorials &amp; Engineering Tools</h1>
  <p>A comprehensive training platform for wind energy professionals</p>
</section>

<main class="tut-content">

  <h2>Learning by doing</h2>
  <p>
    ACMSL's real-time simulators are designed for <strong>practical skills acquisition</strong>. Unlike
    static presentations or textbook exercises, our simulators reproduce the actual behavior of industrial
    wind turbines in real time, allowing trainees to develop intuition and operational skills in a safe,
    controlled environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each simulator includes <strong>integrated tutorials</strong> with step-by-step practical exercises
    that guide the learner from basic concepts to advanced operational scenarios. The tutorials are designed
    to be self-paced, allowing professionals to learn at their own rhythm.
  </p>

  <h2>The 4 simulators</h2>
  <p>
    We recommend following the simulators in the order presented below. Each one builds on the concepts
    learned in the previous one, creating a progressive and coherent learning experience.
  </p>

          Understand variable speed. This simulator models a Family 3 wind turbine with wound rotor
          induction generator and variable rotor resistance. Learn how controlled speed variation
          improves energy capture and provides wind gust tolerance &mdash; the key innovation that

      <div class="body">
        <h4>4. DFIG Wind Turbine</h4>
        <p>
          Master the industry standard. This simulator models the most widely installed wind turbine
          family: the Doubly-Fed Induction Generator. Understand how the Back-to-Back converter
          controls active and reactive power independently, enabling full grid support capabilities
          and compliance with modern grid codes.

  <h2>Engineering tools</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to the simulators, ACMSL provides specialized engineering tools for deeper technical analysis:
  </p>

  <div class="tut-grid">

    <div class="tut-grid-card">
      <div class="body">
        <h4>Operational Curve Calculator (MPPT)</h4>
        <p>
          Design and analyze the optimal power-speed operating curve for variable-speed wind turbines.
          This tool calculates the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) curve based on the turbine's
          aerodynamic characteristics, allowing engineers to understand how optimal tip-speed ratio
          translates into real-world operating points.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Applications:</strong> MPPT curve design, energy yield estimation, partial load
          optimization, comparison of different control strategies.

    </div>

  </div>

  <h2>What makes our simulators different</h2>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Real-time simulation</h4>
    <p>
      Our simulators run in real time, reproducing the actual temporal behavior of wind turbines.
      When you command a pitch change, the blades take the same time to rotate as in a real machine.
      When wind changes, the rotor inertia responds with realistic time constants. This temporal
      fidelity is essential for developing operational intuition.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Integrated tutorials</h4>
    <p>
      Each simulator includes comprehensive tutorials that combine theory and practice. You read about
      a concept, then immediately apply it in the simulator. This learn-then-do approach dramatically
      accelerates skill acquisition compared to classroom-only training.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Safe learning environment</h4>
    <p>
      Mistakes in a real wind turbine can cause equipment damage worth hundreds of thousands of euros
      or endanger lives. Our simulators allow trainees to explore boundary conditions, trigger alarms,
      and even crash the turbine &mdash; all without consequences. Learning from failure is one of the
      most effective training methods, and simulation makes it safe.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Professional-grade fidelity</h4>
    <p>
      The physical models behind our simulators are based on established electrical machine theory,
      aerodynamic models, and control system engineering. The simulators reproduce phenomena that
      professionals encounter in real operations: generator magnetization, torque oscillations,
      grid voltage fluctuations, and wind turbulence effects.
