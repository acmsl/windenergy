  <h2>Wind energy: a consolidated industry</h2>
  <p>
    Wind energy is one of the most consolidated renewable energy sources in the global energy landscape.
    Over the past three decades it has evolved from an experimental technology into a cornerstone of the
    energy transition, with over 1,000 GW of installed capacity worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some countries, wind energy contributes approximately <strong>25% to the national energy mix</strong>,
    with historical production peaks reaching up to <strong>56% of electricity demand</strong> at certain moments.
    This level of penetration demonstrates both the maturity of the technology and the critical importance of
    having well-trained professionals managing these assets.

  <h2>An extraordinary technological evolution</h2>
  <p>
    The rapid technological evolution of the wind energy sector has been remarkable. In just 30 years, wind turbines
    have grown from 50&ndash;100 kW units with 15-meter rotors to machines rated at <strong>15&ndash;21 MW</strong>
    with rotor diameters exceeding 230 meters. This transformation has created a
    <strong>highly specialized industrial ecosystem</strong> spanning component manufacturing, installation,
    commissioning, and the operation and maintenance of wind farms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Control systems have evolved from simple mechanical regulation mechanisms to sophisticated real-time algorithms
    that optimize production, protect the machine, and contribute to electrical grid stability. Understanding
    this evolution is essential for any professional in the sector.
  </p>

  <h2>Why training matters</h2>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Safety-critical operations</h4>
    <p>
      Wind turbines are complex industrial installations operating under demanding conditions: heights
      exceeding 100 meters, medium and high voltage electrical systems, and rotating mechanical components.
      Proper training is indispensable to ensure the safety of technicians and operators.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Operational efficiency</h4>
    <p>
      A well-trained operator can correctly interpret SCADA signals, diagnose anomalies in real time,
      and make decisions that maximize wind farm availability and production. The difference between an
      experienced operator and a novice can translate into a 3&ndash;5% production increase.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Cost reduction</h4>
    <p>
      Preventive maintenance based on deep knowledge of machine behavior allows anticipating failures,
      reducing unplanned downtime, and extending component lifespan. This has a direct impact on the
      project's <em>LCOE</em> (Levelized Cost of Energy).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tut-card">
    <h4>Complex multi-disciplinary systems</h4>
    <p>
      Modern wind turbines integrate aerodynamics, structural mechanics, power electronics, electrical
      machines, meteorology, and advanced control theory. Professionals need a solid cross-disciplinary
      foundation to work effectively in this industry.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>What ACMSL offers</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Automated Computing Machinery SL (ACMSL)</strong> has developed a unique set of training
    tools for the wind energy sector:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>4 real-time simulators</strong> covering the main families of industrial wind turbines &mdash;
    from SCADA control center operations to detailed DFIG wind turbine management.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrated tutorials</strong> within each simulator, with guided practical exercises.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering tools</strong> including the Operational Curve Calculator (MPPT) and the
    DFIG Back-to-Back Analyzer.</li>
    <li><strong>Comprehensive knowledge map</strong> covering all industrial aspects of wind energy,
    from meteorology to project finance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recommended learning path</h2>
  <p>
    We recommend following these tutorials in order. Start by learning about
    <a href="industrial-wind-turbines.html">industrial wind turbines</a>, then explore the
    <a href="wind-turbine-families.html">5 families of wind turbines</a> and the
    <a href="operational-wind-ranges.html">operational wind speed ranges</a>. After that, discover the
    <a href="simulators-and-tutorials.html">available simulators and engineering tools</a> and the
    <a href="wind-energy-mindmap.html">comprehensive knowledge map</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For hands-on practice, we recommend starting with the Active Stall simulator (Family 2) to master
    fundamental concepts, then progressing to the Rotor Resistance Controller (Family 3), and finally
    tackling the DFIG simulator (Family 4) &mdash; the most widely installed wind turbine type today.
